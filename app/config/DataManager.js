The bun was soft and delicious itself, the patties were cooked perfectly and still a bit pink which was amazing, draped in the best american cheese, which just does something brilliant to a burger and the bacon....cooked to a perfect crisp, made the whole experience incredible. Highly recommend this outstanding place. Just be prepared to have a nap after your culinary adventure.",
